# Basic Linear Regression Model

GapMinder collects data from a handful of sources, including the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, US Census Bureau's 
International Database, United Nations Statistics Division and the World Bank

In this occasion I analyse the relation between Co2 emissions as Explanatory variable and breast cancer as response variable. I find that the p value is equal to 0.000183 therefore exists relation between two variables because p or alpha value is less than 0.05 (reject the null hypothesis)

The results of the linear regression model indicated that major co2 emissions (beta = 35.8041, p = 0.000183) was significantly and positively associated with number of breast cancer cases.
